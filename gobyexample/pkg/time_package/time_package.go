	// You can build a time struct by providing the year, month, day, etc. Times are always associated with a Location, i.e. time zone.

		2009, 11, 17, 20, 34, 58, 651387237, time.UTC)

	p(then.Second())
	p(then.Nanosecond())
	p(then.Location())

	p(then.Weekday())

	// These methods compare two times, testing if the first occurs before, after, or at the same time as the second, respectively.

	p(then.Before(now))
	p(then.After(now))
	p(then.Equal(now))

	// The Sub methods returns a Duration representing the interval between two times.

	diff := now.Sub(then)

	// We can compute the length of the duration in various units.

	p(diff.Hours())
	p(diff.Minutes())
	p(diff.Seconds())
	p(diff.Nanoseconds())

	// You can use Add to advance a time by a given duration, or with a - to move backwards by a duration.

	p(then.Add(diff))
