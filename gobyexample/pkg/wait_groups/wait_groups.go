	// This WaitGroup is used to wait for all the goroutines launched here to finish. Note: if a WaitGroup is explicitly passed into functions, it should be done by pointer.

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Launch several goroutines using WaitGroup.Go

	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		wg.Go(func() {
			worker(i)

	// Block until all the goroutines started by wg are done. A goroutine is done when the function it invokes returns.

	wg.Wait()

	// Note that this approach has no straightforward way to propagate errors from workers.
	// For more advanced use cases, consider using the errgroup package.
